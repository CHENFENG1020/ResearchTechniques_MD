    <h2 id="toc_2">Overview:</h2>

    <p>Computational techniques have become an integral part of research, with their importance and contribution to
        scientific discovery growing rapidly in recent years. The use of computational techniques in chemistry has made
        it possible to simulate chemical reactions and predict the properties of molecules with a high degree of
        accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, molecular simulations have made it possible to study complex systems that are difficult,
        if not impossible, to study experimentally, such as large protein complexes, biological membranes, interactions
        of molecules and materials at the interface, processes in space or in extreme conditions. These methods have had
        a positive impact on society by accelerating the development of new drugs, materials, and technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is, therefore, essential for students to have a solid understanding of computational techniques and their
        applications in modern scientific methods. This part of the course, focuses on molecular dynamics simulations,
        one of the most commonly used methodologies in current research. </p>

    <h2 id="toc_4">Course organisation:</h2>

    <p>Sessions 1 - 3 are 3 hours long. Session 4 is 1.5 hours, to introduce the independent projects.</p>

    <p>Students are expected to carry out work independently after each session. </p>

    <p><strong>Drop-in sessions</strong> with demonstrators are scheduled weekly through weeks 3, 4 and 5. You do not
        need to have any specific questions; you are welcome to just come over and work, knowing that a demonstrator
        will be there to help if needed. </p>
</div>
<div class="box">

    <h2 id="toc_5">Assessment:</h2>

    <p>An individual project (started during Session 4) is submitted in the form of a short, written report. The
        templates for the report are provided in the sessions 3 and 4.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_6">Use of AI tools:</h2>

    <p>AI tools can be of great help in many aspects of life, including learning. Please be aware that there are
        limitations to their applicability. This course is made to teach you how to use tools in computational
        chemistry; it is not developed around the use of AI technologies. Therefore, the use of Generative AI during
        learning exercises may limit the uptake of relevant knowledge and hinder the development of necessary
        skills.</p>

    <p>We would also want to bring to your attention the use of Generative AI in the assessments. The assessments are
        expected to contain your original work. All summative submissions will be checked for the presence of
        AI-generated text and code. Therefore, to prevent any flags of misconduct, when AI tools are used to assist you
        during the assessment preparation, you MUST DECLARE it by stating:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> What tool has been used (e.g., ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI);</li>
        <li> What was the exact prompt;</li>
        <li> Link to the output (&lsquo;link to chat&rsquo; for ChatGpT or a compilation of outputs as an appendix);
        </li>
        <li> What modifications have been done to the generated output before it was incorporated into the submitted
            work.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The University Guidance is available <a
